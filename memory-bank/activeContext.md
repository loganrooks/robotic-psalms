### [2025-04-08 06:55:12] - Task: Create Project Specification
- **Focus:** Defining initial project specification (`project_specification.md`) for Robotic Psalms based on user request and provided context summary.
- **Status:** Drafting specification content, preparing to update Memory Bank and write file.


### [2025-04-08 06:59:45] - Task: Create Pseudocode for TTS Fix
- **Focus:** Generated pseudocode (`pseudocode.md`) outlining investigation, fix/replacement strategy for TTS, integration, and robotic effects based on `project_specification.md` and code analysis.
- **Status:** Pseudocode generated and saved. Preparing Memory Bank update and task completion.


### [2025-04-08 07:04:08] - Task: Write Initial Failing Tests (Vocal Synthesis)
- **Focus:** Created initial failing tests (Red phase) for TTS output, robotic effects, VoxDei integration, and SacredMachinery integration.
- **Files Created:** `tests/synthesis/tts/test_espeak.py`, `tests/synthesis/test_vox_dei.py`, `tests/test_sacred_machinery.py`.
- **Status:** Tests created using mock implementations. Ready for implementation phase (Green).



### [2025-04-08 07:33:41] - Task: Implement Vocal Synthesis Fix (eSpeak Buffer Retrieval)
- **Focus:** Modified `lib/espeakmodulecore.cpp` to capture audio buffer in callback and added `get_last_audio_buffer` function. Updated `src/robotic_psalms/synthesis/tts/engines/espeak.py` to use buffer retrieval instead of file I/O. Rebuilt package using `pip install -e`.
- **Status:** Preparing to run tests (`pytest`) to verify the fix.
