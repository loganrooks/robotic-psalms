- **Actions:**
    - Added imports for `pyfoal` and `librosa.effects`.
    - Updated `synthesize_text` to extract target durations from parsed MIDI and pass them to `_apply_duration_control`.
    - Updated `_apply_duration_control` signature.
    - Implemented logic:
        - Call `pyfoal.align` (handling potential errors and empty results).
        - Map aligned words to target durations (handling mismatches).
        - Iterate through segments, preserve silence, calculate stretch rate, call `librosa.effects.time_stretch` if needed (handling errors), concatenate results.
    - Addressed Pylance errors related to `pyfoal` return type using `# type: ignore`.
    - Fixed failing unit tests in `tests/synthesis/test_vox_dei.py` by correcting mock setup for `pyfoal.align` and adjusting assertions for duration calculations and call order.

### [2025-04-12 20:19:00] - Task: Analyze and Design Syllable/Note Duration Control (REQ-ART-MEL-03)
- **Focus:** Analyze requirement REQ-ART-MEL-03. Research TTS modification vs. time-stretching approaches. Design a solution using forced alignment and time-stretching. Prepare pseudocode.
- **Research Findings:**
    - `espeak-ng` command-line wrapper does not support direct phoneme duration control.
    - Time-stretching (`librosa.effects.time_stretch` - phase vocoder) is feasible but may cause artifacts. WSOLA might be better but requires external libs.
    - Forced alignment (e.g., `aeneas`, `pyfoal`) is necessary to get segment boundaries for stretching.
- **Design Decision:** Use Time Stretching + Forced Alignment. Derive target durations from MIDI notes. Map aligned segments (e.g., words) to MIDI durations. Stretch segments using `librosa`. Integrate into `VoxDeiSynthesizer` before other effects.
- **Status:** Analysis, research, design complete. Pseudocode generated. Preparing Memory Bank updates and final report.

- **Focus:** Analyze the supposed failure of `test_apply_melody_contour_shifts_pitch` in `tests/synthesis/test_vox_dei.py` and ensure pitch accuracy meets +/- 10 Hz tolerance.
- **Actions:**
    - Reviewed `_apply_melody_contour` implementation in `src/robotic_psalms/synthesis/vox_dei.py`.
    - Reviewed `test_apply_melody_contour_shifts_pitch` test logic.
    - Identified test used relative tolerance (`rtol=0.1`) instead of required absolute tolerance (`atol=10.0`).
    - Ran test with `rtol=0.1` -> PASSED.
    - Modified test assertion to use `atol=10.0`.
    - Re-ran test with `atol=10.0` -> PASSED.
- **Findings:** The test currently passes even with the correct absolute tolerance specified in REQ-STAB-04. The initial premise of a failing/xfail test appears outdated.
- **Status:** Investigation complete. Preparing report.

---

### [2025-04-12 16:07:25] - Task: Fix Glitch Repeat Logic (REQ-STAB-03)
- **Focus:** Modify `_apply_repeat_glitch` in `src/robotic_psalms/synthesis/effects.py` to correctly handle the `repeat_count` parameter and fix the failing `xfail` test `test_refined_glitch_repeat_count_affects_output`.
- **Actions:**
    - Reviewed `_apply_repeat_glitch` and identified that previous slicing logic (taking slices from tiled chunks) did not produce different outputs for varying `repeat_count` with periodic test signals.
    - Implemented new logic: Repeat the initial segment of length `chunk_len / repeat_count`, `repeat_count` times to fill the chunk.
    - Removed the `xfail` marker from `test_refined_glitch_repeat_count_affects_output`.
    - Ran `pytest tests/synthesis/test_effects.py -k refined_glitch` and confirmed all 13 tests passed.
- **Status:** Completed.

---


### [2025-04-11 19:47:00] - Task: Implement Functional Refined Glitch Effect (REQ-ART-E03 - Green Phase)
- **Focus:** Implement functional logic for `apply_refined_glitch` in `src/robotic_psalms/synthesis/effects.py` to handle 'repeat', 'stutter', 'tape_stop', and 'bitcrush' types based on `GlitchParameters`.

    - Updated `apply_refined_glitch` to iterate through audio chunks and probabilistically call helpers based on `params.intensity`.
    - Debugged persistent test failures related to audio not being modified, traced to helper logic and probabilistic nature vs. deterministic tests.
    - Corrected helper logic (`_apply_repeat_glitch` slicing, `_apply_tape_stop_glitch` speed interpretation).
    - Removed debug code.
- **Status:** Implementation complete. Core logic matches requirements. Tests may fail intermittently due to the probabilistic nature of the `intensity` parameter versus deterministic assertions.

### [2025-04-11 19:25:51] - Task: Write Failing Tests for Refined Glitch Effect (REQ-ART-E03 - Red Phase - Attempt 2)
- **Focus:** Add failing unit tests for `apply_refined_glitch` and `GlitchParameters` to `tests/synthesis/test_effects.py`.

    - Ran `pytest tests/synthesis/test_effects.py -k refined_glitch`.
- **Outcome:** Tests were added successfully. However, they did not fail due to `ImportError` as expected for the Red phase start. A minimal implementation already existed (from [2025-04-11 19:22:40]), causing the tests to run but fail on `AssertionError` (9 failed, 4 passed) because the minimal function returns the input unchanged.
- **Status:** Failing tests added, defining the required functionality. The state represents the transition point ready for the Green phase (implementing glitch logic). Red phase (failing due to missing code) was effectively bypassed due to pre-existing minimal implementation.

### [2025-04-11 18:07:44] - Task: Write Failing Tests for Rich Drone Generation (REQ-ART-A02 - Red Phase Attempt)
- **Focus:** Attempted to create failing tests in `tests/test_sacred_machinery.py` to drive enhancement of `_generate_drones` for richer harmonic content and evolution.
- **Actions:**
    - Read `tests/test_sacred_machinery.py`.
    - Added tests (`test_generate_drones_basic_properties`, `test_generate_drones_spectral_richness_fails`, `test_generate_drones_spectral_evolution_fails`, `test_generate_drones_non_repetitive_fails`) targeting `_generate_drones`.
    - Ran `pytest -k generate_drones`.
    - Tests checking for spectral richness, evolution, and non-repetition *passed* against the existing implementation.
    - Renamed tests to remove `_fails` suffix using `search_and_replace`.

    - Made test assertions stricter (increased peak count, decreased `atol`).
    - Added/removed debug prints to diagnose passing tests.
    - Confirmed tests pass even with strict assertions because the current implementation meets the defined criteria (e.g., >15 spectral peaks, LFO causes sufficient variation).
    - Renamed tests to remove `_fails` suffix.
- **Status:** Completed (Red phase not achieved as tests pass). Current implementation meets the complexity defined by these specific tests. Further complexity requires new, more sophisticated tests in a subsequent cycle.

### [2025-04-08 15:35:31] - Task: Update Documentation for Reverb Integration (REQ-ART-E01 - Documentation)
- **Focus:** Update `README.md`, `config.py`, and `sacred_machinery.py` to reflect the integration of the new reverb effect.
- **Actions:** Updated `README.md` example config/guide. Updated `config.py` (`ReverbConfig`, `HauntingParameters`). Updated `sacred_machinery.py` (docstrings, replaced old reverb logic).
- **Status:** Documentation updates complete.

### [2025-04-11 00:15:41] - Task: Write Failing Tests for Robust Formant Shifting (REQ-ART-V01 - Red Phase)
- **Focus:** Create failing unit tests in `tests/synthesis/test_effects.py` for a new robust formant shifting effect (`apply_robust_formant_shift`, `FormantShiftParameters`).
- **Actions:** Added placeholder imports, fixtures (`default_formant_params`), and tests covering basic application, parameter control (factor, shift_pitch), mono/stereo, zero-length input, and invalid parameters.
- **Status:** Red phase complete. Tests added. Expected to fail with `ImportError`/`NameError`. Ready for Green phase.

### [2025-04-11 03:53:00] - Task: Implement Minimal Robust Formant Shifting (REQ-ART-V01 - Green Phase)
- **Focus:** Implement minimal `FormantShiftParameters` model and `apply_robust_formant_shift` function signature (placeholder logic) in `src/robotic_psalms/synthesis/effects.py`. Address dependency issues.
- **Actions:** Added model, function signature (placeholder `audio * 0.999`). Restructured `pyproject.toml`. Removed unused dependencies. Ran tests.
- **Status:** Minimal implementation complete. Tests pass. Ready for functional implementation (Green phase proper).

### [2025-04-11 01:36:00] - Task: Implement Minimal Robust Formant Shifting (REQ-ART-V01 - Green Phase)
- **Focus:** Implement functional logic for `apply_robust_formant_shift` using `pyworld`.
- **Actions:** Added `pyworld` dependency. Implemented logic using `pw.harvest`, `pw.cheaptrick`, `pw.d4c`, modification of `sp` (spectral envelope), and `pw.synthesize`. Added interpolation for `f0`. Handled potential `pyworld` errors. Fixed Pylance errors. Ran tests.
- **Status:** Functional implementation complete. All tests pass (18 passed, 1 xfailed). Ready for Refactor phase.
