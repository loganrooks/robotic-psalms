### [2025-04-08 10:24:16] - Source: User
- **Issue/Feedback**: The `attempt_completion` message for resolving Pylance issues in `vox_dei.py` was too brief and lacked detail.
- **Analysis**: The user requires a more comprehensive summary of the actions taken and their results.
- **Action Taken/Learnings**: Will provide a more detailed `attempt_completion` message, explicitly listing the issues found, the specific changes made (including function names and methods used), and confirming both Pylance resolution and test success.

### [2025-04-12 05:29:25] - Source: User
- **Issue/Feedback**: Failed to run the full test suite after implementing MIDI parsing and fixing related errors, potentially missing regressions introduced in other modules (specifically `vox_dei.py`).
- **Analysis**: Running only module-specific tests after changes is insufficient. The full test suite must be run to catch unintended side effects or regressions in dependent code.
- **Action Taken/Learnings**: Will ensure the full test suite (`poetry run pytest`) is executed after significant changes or fixes, especially those involving shared functions or modified interfaces, before considering a task complete. Recorded this feedback.
