- **Issue/Feedback**: The `attempt_completion` message for resolving Pylance issues in `vox_dei.py` was too brief and lacked detail.
- **Analysis**: The user requires a more comprehensive summary of the actions taken and their results.
- **Action Taken/Learnings**: Will provide a more detailed `attempt_completion` message, explicitly listing the issues found, the specific changes made (including function names and methods used), and confirming both Pylance resolution and test success.
