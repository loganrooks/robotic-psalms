# Holistic Reviewer Mode Feedback Log

## [2025-04-13 00:08:00] - User Feedback: Report Detail Level
- **Source:** User message during Holistic Review task (Documentation Focus) on 2025-04-13.
- **Issue:** Initial `attempt_completion` message provided a summary report, but the user required a more detailed version including specific diagnostics (what, where, why), detailed cross-referenced fix recommendations, and inclusion of specific examples (like the workflow) within the report itself.
- **Action:** Generated a more detailed report (`detailed_review_report_20250413.md`) and included it in the final `attempt_completion` message. Future reviews by Holistic Reviewer should aim for this level of detail in the final report by default, potentially writing the detailed report to a file first and then including its content in the completion message.
