- **Issue/Feedback**: Subtasks (delegated modes) should provide more detailed summaries upon completion to avoid the need for follow-up prompting by the user/orchestrator.
- **Analysis**: SPARC's default completion messages were too brief, requiring extra interaction.
- **Action Taken/Learnings**: SPARC will explicitly request more detailed summaries in future `new_task` messages.
