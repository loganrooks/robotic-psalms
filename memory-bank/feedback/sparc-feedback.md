- **Issue/Feedback**: Subtasks (delegated modes) should provide more detailed summaries upon completion to avoid the need for follow-up prompting by the user/orchestrator.
- **Analysis**: SPARC's default completion messages were too brief, requiring extra interaction.
- **Action Taken/Learnings**: SPARC will explicitly request more detailed summaries in future `new_task` messages.

- **Issue/Feedback**: After every complete feature cycle (implementation, testing, refactoring, documentation), the changes should be committed to git for good version control.
- **Analysis**: Workflow was missing a crucial version control step after feature completion.
- **Action Taken/Learnings**: SPARC will now incorporate a git commit step (likely delegated to `devops` or executed directly if permissions allow) after each fully completed feature cycle and before starting the next feature.
