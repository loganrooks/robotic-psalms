- **Issue/Feedback**: The summary provided in the `attempt_completion` result was not detailed enough. Requested a more detailed report of the changes made.
- **Analysis**: The initial summary listed the sections changed but lacked specifics about the content modifications (e.g., exact wording, line numbers).
- **Action Taken/Learnings**: Will provide a more granular summary in the next `attempt_completion` call, detailing the specific insertions and modifications made to `project_specification_v3.md`. Future summaries should aim for this level of detail.
