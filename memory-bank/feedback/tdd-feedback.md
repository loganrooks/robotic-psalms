### [2025-04-11 14:18:03] - Source: User
- **Issue/Feedback**: User asked for clarification on "7 deselected" in pytest output after running `pytest -k`.
- **Analysis**: The explanation provided in the `attempt_completion` message was insufficient regarding the pytest output details.
- **Action Taken/Learnings**: Will provide a clearer explanation of `pytest -k` behavior and the meaning of "deselected" tests in the future. Updated the completion attempt.

### [2025-04-12 17:59:47] - Source: User
- **Issue/Feedback**: User identified repeated incorrect tool usage format (e.g., `<tool_name>list_files</tool_name>` instead of `<list_files>...</list_files>`). User suggested the system prompt phrase "The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags" might be misinterpreted as meaning the literal tool name string should be wrapped in `<tool_name>` tags.
- **Analysis**: The user's hypothesis is plausible. The phrasing could indeed be interpreted ambiguously, leading to the observed incorrect format.
- **Action Taken/Learnings**: Acknowledged the feedback. Will ensure strict adherence to the correct XML format (`<tool_name><param>value</param></tool_name>`) going forward. This feedback highlights the importance of precise instruction wording for LLM interaction.
