- **Issue/Feedback**: User asked for clarification on "7 deselected" in pytest output after running `pytest -k`.
- **Analysis**: The explanation provided in the `attempt_completion` message was insufficient regarding the pytest output details.
- **Action Taken/Learnings**: Will provide a clearer explanation of `pytest -k` behavior and the meaning of "deselected" tests in the future. Updated the completion attempt.
