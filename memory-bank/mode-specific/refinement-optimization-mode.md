### Optimization: 2025-04-08 14:51:15 - Refactor effects.py and test_effects.py
- **Target**: `src/robotic_psalms/synthesis/effects.py`, `tests/synthesis/test_effects.py`
- **Type**: Readability/Maintainability
- **Desc**: Refactored `effects.py` to use constants for magic numbers in decay calculation and added comments. Removed commented-out, irrelevant tests from `test_effects.py`.
- **Metrics Before**: N/A (Focus on readability)
- **Metrics After**: N/A
- **Related Debt**: N/A
- **Related Issue**: N/A

### Optimization: [2025-04-11 15:04:00] - Refactor Formant Shifter Integration Code & Tests (REQ-ART-V01)
- **Target**: `src/robotic_psalms/synthesis/vox_dei.py`, `tests/synthesis/test_vox_dei.py`
- **Type**: Readability/Maintainability
- **Desc**: Refactored `vox_dei.py`: Moved `soundfile`/`pathlib` imports into debug blocks, removed unused `typing.Protocol`, added `_MIN_SOSFILTFILT_LEN` constant for filter checks. Refactored `test_vox_dei.py`: Renamed `input_audio` to `mock_synth_output_audio` in `test_robotic_effects_modify_audio` for clarity.
- **Metrics Before**: N/A
- **Metrics After**: N/A
- **Related Debt**: N/A
- **Related Issue**: N/A

### Optimization: [2025-04-11 15:59:32] - Refactor Complex Delay Implementation & Tests (REQ-ART-V02)
- **Target**: `src/robotic_psalms/synthesis/effects.py`, `tests/synthesis/test_effects.py`
- **Type**: Readability/Maintainability
- **Desc**: Refactored `effects.py`: Removed duplicate/unused imports, added comments to `DelayParameters` indicating ignored fields (stereo_spread, LFO, filters), added comment acknowledging known `pedalboard.Delay` feedback issue. Refactored `test_effects.py`: Reverted incorrect import consolidation attempt. Confirmed test results (22 passed, 6 xfailed) unchanged.
- **Metrics Before**: N/A
- **Metrics After**: N/A
- **Related Debt**: N/A
- **Related Issue**: REQ-ART-V02

### Optimization: [2025-04-11 16:14:00] - Refactor Complex Delay Integration Code & Tests (REQ-ART-V02)
- **Target**: `src/robotic_psalms/synthesis/sacred_machinery.py`, `tests/test_sacred_machinery.py`
- **Type**: Modularity/Readability/Maintainability
- **Desc**: Refactored `sacred_machinery.py`: Extracted delay application logic into `_apply_configured_delay` helper method, removed debug code. Refactored `test_sacred_machinery.py`: Introduced `engine_factory` fixture to reduce setup duplication for tests requiring modified configurations.
- **Metrics Before**: N/A
- **Metrics After**: N/A
- **Related Debt**: N/A
- **Related Issue**: REQ-ART-V02
