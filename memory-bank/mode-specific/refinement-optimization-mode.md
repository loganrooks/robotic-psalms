### Optimization: [2025-04-11 15:04:00] - Refactor Formant Shifter Integration Code & Tests (REQ-ART-V01)
- **Target**: `src/robotic_psalms/synthesis/vox_dei.py`, `tests/synthesis/test_vox_dei.py`
- **Type**: Readability/Maintainability
- **Desc**: Refactored `vox_dei.py`: Moved `soundfile`/`pathlib` imports into debug blocks, removed unused `typing.Protocol`, added `_MIN_SOSFILTFILT_LEN` constant for filter checks. Refactored `test_vox_dei.py`: Renamed `input_audio` to `mock_synth_output_audio` in `test_robotic_effects_modify_audio` for clarity.
