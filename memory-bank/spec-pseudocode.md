## Functional Requirements

### Feature: Vocal Processing Enhancements
- Added: 2025-04-08 12:19:01
- Description: Enhance the vocal processing pipeline to achieve a more ethereal and atmospheric sound, moving away from basic robotic TTS output.
- Acceptance criteria:
    1. Implement or integrate a robust formant shifting algorithm (e.g., phase vocoder based) to minimize artifacts.
    2. Replace or enhance existing timbre blend filters (`_choir_filter`, `_android_filter`, `_machinery_filter`) with effects suitable for atmospheric vocal textures (e.g., dense reverb, complex delays).
    3. Implement a mechanism for layering multiple vocal takes with slight variations (pitch, timing, effects).
    4. [Optional] Explore integrating granular synthesis for vocal processing.
    5. [Optional] Implement pitch correction/modification based on input (e.g., MIDI).
    6. [Optional] Implement syllable duration control based on input.
- Dependencies: Requires a suitable TTS engine or audio processing library capable of formant shifting and potentially pitch/duration manipulation.
- Status: Draft

### Feature: Ambient Layer Generation Enhancements
- Added: 2025-04-08 12:19:01
- Description: Improve the generation of pad and drone sounds to be more complex and evolving, fitting an atmospheric style.
- Acceptance criteria:
    1. Enhance pad generation (`_generate_pads`) to create more complex, evolving textures (e.g., wavetable/additive synthesis).
    2. Enhance drone generation (`_generate_drones`) for richer harmonic content and movement (e.g., complex FM, crossfading, detuning).
- Dependencies: Requires suitable synthesis libraries or tools.
- Status: Draft

### Feature: Effects Processing Enhancements
- Added: 2025-04-08 12:19:01
- Description: Improve the quality and controllability of effects processing.
- Acceptance criteria:
    1. Replace the basic reverb (`_generate_reverb_ir`) with a sophisticated algorithm (e.g., FDN) or allow convolution reverb via IR loading. Expose relevant parameters (pre-delay, diffusion, decay, damping).
    2. Replace or enhance the spectral freeze (`_spectral_freeze`) for smoother, more controllable sustained textures.
    3. Refine the glitch effect (`_apply_glitch_effect`) for more control and subtlety (e.g., parameterize type/intensity, add tape-style effects).
    4. Introduce configurable analog-style saturation/distortion modules.
- Dependencies: Requires suitable audio processing libraries or tools.
- Status: Draft

### Feature: Mixing and Dynamics Enhancements
- Added: 2025-04-08 12:19:01
- Description: Improve the mixing and dynamics processing capabilities.
- Acceptance criteria:
    1. Implement basic master bus processing (e.g., slow compression, limiting).
    2. [Optional] Introduce panning controls for individual layers.
- Dependencies: Requires suitable audio processing libraries or tools.
- Status: Draft

## System Constraints

- **Constraint:** Python 3.x environment.
  - Added: 2025-04-08 12:19:01
  - Description: The project is currently implemented in Python 3. New code should adhere to this.
  - Impact: Limits the choice of external libraries to those compatible with Python 3.
  - Mitigation: Use established Python audio libraries like `librosa`, `scipy`, `numpy`.

- **Constraint:** Offline Processing Focus.
  - Added: 2025-04-08 12:19:01
  - Description: The current system seems designed for offline generation of audio rather than real-time performance.
  - Impact: Processing time is less critical than output quality and flexibility. Complex algorithms are feasible.
  - Mitigation: N/A (Leverage this constraint).

## Edge Cases

*   **Edge Case:** Empty Input Text
    *   Identified: 2025-04-08 12:19:01
    *   Scenario: The input text file for vocal synthesis is empty or contains only whitespace.
    *   Expected behavior: The system should handle this gracefully, perhaps by generating silence or a minimal vocal effect, and logging a warning.
    *   Testing approach: Provide an empty text file as input.

*   **Edge Case:** Non-Latin Characters in Text
    *   Identified: 2025-04-08 12:19:01
    *   Scenario: The input text contains characters outside the expected Latin alphabet (e.g., Cyrillic, Kanji).
    *   Expected behavior: The TTS engine might fail or produce unexpected output. The system should detect and handle/report such issues.
    *   Testing approach: Input text with characters from different scripts.

*   **Edge Case:** Invalid MIDI Input (if implemented)
    *   Identified: 2025-04-08 12:19:01
    *   Scenario: A provided MIDI file is corrupted or doesn't conform to the expected format for melody/duration information.
    *   Expected behavior: The system should detect the invalid input and report an error, possibly falling back to a default melody or monotone output.
    *   Testing approach: Input various malformed or incompatible MIDI files.

*   **Edge Case:** Very Long Input Text/MIDI
    *   Identified: 2025-04-08 12:19:01
    *   Scenario: The input text or MIDI file is exceptionally long.
    *   Expected behavior: The system should handle large inputs without excessive memory consumption or crashing. Processing time will increase.
    *   Testing approach: Generate large text/MIDI files and use them as input. Monitor memory usage.
